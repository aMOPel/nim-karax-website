Dotfiles contains my configuration files for the development tools.

It is currently built to work well on a ubuntu based Linux distro,
but it could also be adapted to work on other Linux distros or windows with WSL.

The term "dotfiles" stems from the convention on Linux to
put configuration files in hidden folders, which start with a `.`.

If deployed on an eligible system it can be set up in quite little time 
as most of the setup process is scripted.

The mentionable tools that are configured are 
- NeoVim (terminal based text editor with similar extensibility to VSCode)
- Ranger (terminal UI file explorer)
- ZSH (shell, slightly fancier than bash)
- Kitty (modern terminal emulator)

The benefits of choosing such a terminal heavy set of tools are:
- keyboard focused workflow, ergonomic, fast
- scriptability/automation of every task
