# [godot-grid](https://github.com/aMOPel/godot-grid)

This is a utility library for the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
, written in gdscript.

It makes use of my other godot library [godot-exchange-scene](#/godot_exchange_scene).

The goal was to provide numerous utilities for working with rectangular grids.

This project came to be, because I was writing a tetris clone with Godot.
Then it grew a little bigger afterwards as I grew more interested in the topic.

Overall it was a fun excercise, but taught me the limits of gdscript and its
performance, as I tried to test out the limits of this library.
