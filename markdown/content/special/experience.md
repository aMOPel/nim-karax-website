My experience gathered in programming related fields so far.

## Programming languages 

### Nim 
About two years ago I discovered a less known language called [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), 
that seemed very exciting at first and managed to remain exciting. 
That is why most of my more recent projects use it in some capacity. 
Like when I was learning C++, learning Nim in depth gave me some deeper insights 
into software engineering concepts like meta programming and garbage collection. 

### JavaScript/TypeScript (and HTML+CSS) 
I had no real contact with JavaScript throughout my studies, 
but I had to get into it, when I helped with a Vue project. 
It wasn't very hard, due to my knowledge of the previously learned languages. 
Of course, I also had to refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS, which I was already 
somewhat familiar with.
Although I am familiar with most concepts surrounding web development,
I am still missing many of the details necessary.

### C++ 
I took a computer graphics course, which required writing C++, which turned out to 
be not as hard as I thought. 
A while later I worked through [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/), 
which gave me a much better grasp of 
types, pointers, references, passing by value/reference, 
compile time vs runtime, stack vs heap, and some other 
software engineering concepts, that I hadn't really understood before.

### Python 
During my studies I had to learn more about Python and thus I read 
most of the [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) back then. 
I haven't written a lot of Python since those days, except for in my bachelor thesis. 
However I still enjoy it due to its concise syntax and extreme flexibility in
use cases. 

### SQL 
I took various database courses, some of which included practical usage of PostgreSQL. 
I haven't used SQL a lot since then. 
It only came to use, in my [tasketeer.nim](#/tasketeer_nim) project. 
In there I used SQLite and an ORM library. 
However I found that I still felt quite comfortable writing SQL Queries. 

### Java 
In the first semesters of my studies I had to use some Java for various exercises. 
I haven't really used it since, so my Java knowledge is extremely rusty. 

## Frameworks 

Other than Godot and (a little) Vue I haven't really explored bigger Frameworks, 
since I didn't really do projects of bigger scale yet. 

## Other Technologies 

### Linux Terminal 
Probably the most noteworthy technology I am familiar with is the 
terminal environment on Linux. 
Due to my terminal focused workflow, and a few years of experience I am well 
versed with the user level aspects. 

### Git 
Git has been my VCS of choice for a long time now and as you can see on my GitHub 
profile I am also familiar with the GitHub additions to the Git workflow, namely 
working with Issues and PRs. I didn't use GitHub actions yet, however build
scripts I use build scripts for building and more regularly.

### Docker 
During my studies I also had to use a few docker containers, so I at least have 
a superficial understanding of its usage. 

## Tooling

Since I spent a lot of time learning and configuring Vim/NeoVim and other tools
in the terminal, I have a decent understanding of the development tool domain.

Among others, I came in contact with:
- LSP Servers, which are usually responsible for 
  - Linting and Code Actions
  - Providing completion items
  - Formatting (some)
  - Intelligent Code Navigation like "go to definition" / "go to references"
- Syntax Highlighting (In NeoVim mostly done by Tree-Sitter, but also by RegEx Grammars)
- Debug Adapters (mostly DAP)
- Snippet Engines
- Grep-likes, RegEx/Globbing and fuzzy finders for efficient searching and replacing
- Scripting for building/deploying (in `sh` or some programming language)
