## Programming languages 

*Order: most to least recently learned*

### Nim 
Two years ago I discovered a lesser known language called [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/),
which still excites me.
That is why most of my more recent projects use it in some capacity,
including this website. 
Like C++, learning Nim has given me a deeper understanding of software engineering.
It also introduced me to meta programming and garbage collection.

### JavaScript/TypeScript (and HTML+CSS) 
I had no real contact with JavaScript throughout my studies, 
but I got into it, when I helped with a Vue project. 
It came easily to me because of my knowledge of previously learned languages. 
That entailed refreshing my knowledge of HTML and CSS, which I was already 
somewhat familiar with.
Working in web development was fun and I am very interested in working in that domain more.
I find back-end development particularly interesting.

### C++ 
In my studies I took a computer graphics course.
Our projects were written in C++.
A while later I worked through [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/), 
which gave me a much better grasp of
types, pointers, references, passing by value/reference, 
compile time vs runtime, stack vs heap, and some other 
software engineering concepts.

### GDScript
GDScript is the primary scripting language in 
the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
It is tailored to make development with Godot easy.
Overall it is a simple language, with a syntax somewhat resembling Python's.
In the [Project Index](#/index) you can find a few projects I used GDScript in.

### Python 
In one of my courses I needed to use Python and thus I worked through 
most of the [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) back then. 
I used it again in my [bachelor thesis](fomu_trng) for hardware programming. 
I've grown to appreciate statically typed languages, so Python wouldn't be my
first choice for some applications.
However I still enjoy it because of its concise syntax and extreme flexibility in
use cases.

### SQL 
In my studies I took various database courses.
One included practical usage of a PostgreSQL database by writing SQL Queries.
I used SQL again in my [tasketeer.nim](#/tasketeer_nim) project,
in which I used SQLite and an ORM library. 

### Java 
I studied an practiced the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming with 
Java when I started my bachelors degree.

## Tooling

### Git 
I am proficient with Git and very familiar with GitHub.
I have plenty of practice with Issues,
branches, forks, pull requests, merging and rebasing.
I would enjoy more reasons to play with GitHub Actions.

### Docker 
During my studies I used a few Docker containers,
so I have basic understanding of using Docker.

### Linux Shell 
The Linux shell is one of my most noteworthy competencies.
Due to my terminal focused workflow and 3 years of experience,
I am more than comfortable in the Linux environment.
You may read more about my experience with the (L)inux landscape in
my article about my [dotfiles](#/dotfiles).

### IDE and miscellaneous developer tooling
Since I spent a lot of time learning and configuring Vim/NeoVim and other tools
in the terminal, I have a good understanding of the development tool domain.

Among others, I came in contact with:
- LSP Servers, which are usually responsible for 
  - Linting and Code Actions
  - Providing completion items
  - Formatting
  - Intelligent Code Navigation like "go to definition" / "go to references"
- Syntax Highlighting (In NeoVim mostly done by Tree-Sitter, but also by RegEx Grammars)
- Debug Adapters (mostly DAP)
- Snippet Engines
- Grep-likes like [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), RegEx/Globbing and fuzzy finders for efficient searching and replacing
- Scripting for building/deploying (in `sh` or some programming language)
