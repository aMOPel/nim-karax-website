## Programming languages 

*Order: recency of learning.* 

### Nim 
About two years ago I discovered a less known language called [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), 
that excited me and still keeps doing so.
That is why most of my more recent projects use it in some capacity,
including this website. 
Like when I was learning C++, learning Nim in depth gave me some deeper insights 
into software engineering concepts like meta programming and garbage collection. 

### JavaScript/TypeScript (and HTML+CSS) 
I had no real contact with JavaScript throughout my studies, 
but I had to get into it, when I helped with a Vue project. 
It wasn't very hard, due to my knowledge of the previously learned languages. 
Of course, I also had to refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS, which I was already 
somewhat familiar with.
Although I am familiar with most concepts surrounding web development,
I am still missing practical experience and detail knowledge 
for many topics. After all is a vast field.

### C++ 
In my studies I took a computer graphics course, which required writing C++.
It turned out to be not as hard as I thought. 
A while later I worked through [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/), 
which gave me a much better grasp of 
types, pointers, references, passing by value/reference, 
compile time vs runtime, stack vs heap, and some other 
software engineering concepts, that I hadn't really understood before.

### GDScript
GDScript is the primary scripting language in the 
[Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
It is tailored to make development with Godot easy.
Overall it is a simple language, with a syntax somewhat resembling Python's.
In the [Project Index](#/index) you can find a few projects I used GDScript in.

### Python 
During my studies I had to learn more about Python and thus I read 
most of the [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) back then. 
I haven't written a lot of Python since those days, except for in my bachelor thesis. 
I've grown to appreciate statically typed languages, so Python wouldn't be my
first choice for many applications,
however I still enjoy it, due to its concise syntax and extreme flexibility in
use cases.

### SQL 
In my studies I took various database courses,
some of which included practical usage of PostgreSQL. 
I haven't used SQL a lot since then. 
It only came to use, in my [tasketeer.nim](#/tasketeer_nim) project. 
In there I used SQLite and an ORM library. 
However I found that I still felt quite comfortable using SQL. 

### Java 
In the first semesters of my studies I had to use some Java for various exercises. 
I haven't really used it since, so my Java knowledge is quite rusty. 

## Tooling

### Git 
I've been using Git for a long time now and as you can see on my GitHub 
profile I am also familiar with the GitHub additions to the Git workflow, namely 
working with Issues, PRs and Forks. I didn't use GitHub Actions yet, however 
I regularly use custom build scripts for building and more.

### Docker 
During my studies I also had to use a few docker containers, so I at least have 
a superficial understanding of its usage. 

### Linux Terminal 
Probably the most noteworthy technology I am familiar with is the 
terminal environment on Linux. 
Due to my terminal focused workflow, and a few years of experience I am well 
versed with the user level aspects. 

### Editor & Co.
Since I spent a lot of time learning and configuring Vim/NeoVim and other tools
in the terminal, I have a decent understanding of the development tool domain.

Among others, I came in contact with:
- LSP Servers, which are usually responsible for 
  - Linting and Code Actions
  - Providing completion items
  - Formatting (some)
  - Intelligent Code Navigation like "go to definition" / "go to references"
- Syntax Highlighting (In NeoVim mostly done by Tree-Sitter, but also by RegEx Grammars)
- Debug Adapters (mostly DAP)
- Snippet Engines
- Grep-likes, RegEx/Globbing and fuzzy finders for efficient searching and replacing
- Scripting for building/deploying (in `sh` or some programming language)
