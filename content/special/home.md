# Welcome!

This website is a display of my **programming experiences** so far.

You can read about the [General Experience](#/experience) I gathered so far
and my past [Open Source Projects](#/index).

Also you can get an insight into my interests, including:
- the [NeoVim Text Editor](https://neovim.io/),
- the [Nim programming Language](https://nim-lang.org/),
- the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and 
- the **Linux Open Source Landscape** in general.
