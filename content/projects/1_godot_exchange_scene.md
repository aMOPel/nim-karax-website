This is a utility library for the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
, written in GDScript.

The use case is very specific to the Godot engine,
so I'm not going to get into that.

GDScript is the custom scripting language of the Godot engine.
It resembles Python in some aspects, but overall it is very simplistic.

This project was probably my first real experience of writing a slightly 
bigger project and making it available to the public.
This entailed that I had to document and test my code, which probably took more 
time than writing the actual code, but significantly improved the code quality,
since it revealed several bugs and issues.
