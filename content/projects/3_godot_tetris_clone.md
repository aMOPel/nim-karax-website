A simple Tetris clone made with the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

![Tetris In Game](assets/tetris_in_game.png) 

It uses my other 2 Godot projects: [godot-exchange-scene](#/godot_exchange_scene) and [godot-grid](#/godot_grid).

This is the only real game I've made with Godot so far. I am planning on more, though.

Finishing the project took me a little while,
and I didn't even implement the so-called "super rotation system",
which allows for tiles to be rotated into narrow spaces,
despite the way there being blocked.

However it was a fun project for sure, and it gave me an insight into some
intricacies of Godot and game development in general.
Suffice it to say:
Game Development is quite involved and requires the mastery of a lot of disciplines.
