## About My Studies

It took me a while to warm up to my studies.
In the beginning I had no direction and did the bare minimum.
Only in the last quarter I really found intrinsic motivation and
started to see improvement in my grades.

Exploring the Linux open source landscape, and in particular Vim,
was a major contributor to that motivation.
It sparked my interest for many other fields of software development
and led to me trying new technologies out of sheer curiosity.
It gave me a passion for writing code.

Since then, I've written multiple [Open Source Projects](#/open_source_projects) in
my spare time.
